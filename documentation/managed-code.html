              <h1 id="what-is-managed-code-">What is &quot;managed code&quot;?</h1>
<p>When working with .NET Framework, you will often encounter the term
&quot;managed code&quot;. This document will explain what this term means and
additional information around it.</p>
<p>To put it very simply, managed code is just that: code whose execution
is managed by a runtime. In this case, the runtime in question is called
the <strong>Common Language Runtime</strong> or CLR, regardless of the implementation
(<a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> or .NET Framework or .NET Core).
CLR is in charge of taking the managed code, compiling it into machine
code and then executing it. On top of that, runtime provides several
important services such as automatic memory management, security
boundaries, type safety etc.</p>
<p>Contrast this to the way you would run a C/C++ program, also called
&quot;unmanaged code&quot;. In the unmanaged world, the programmer is in charge of
pretty much everything. The actual program is, essentially, a binary
that the operating system (OS) loads into memory and starts. Everything
else, from memory management to security considerations are a burden of
the programmer.</p>
<p>Managed code is written in one of the high-level languages that can be
run on top of the .NET platform, such as C#, Visual Basic, F# and
others. When you compile code written in those languages with their
respective compiler, you don&#39;t get machine code. You get <strong>Intermmidiate
Language</strong> code which the runtime then compiles and executes. C++ is the
one exception to this rule, as it can also produce native, unmanaged
binaries that run on Windows.</p>
<h2 id="intermediate-language-execution">Intermediate Language &amp; Execution</h2>
<p>What is &quot;Intermediate Language&quot; (or IL for short)? It is a product of
compilation of code written in high-level .NET languages. Once you
compile your code written in one of these languages, you will get a
binary that is made out of IL. It is important to note that the IL is
independent from any specific language that runs on top of the runtime;
there is even a separate specification for it that you can read if
you&#39;re so inclined.</p>
<p>Once you produce IL from your high-level code, you will most likely want
to run it. This is where the CLR takes over and starts the process of
<strong>Just-In-Time</strong> compiling, or <strong>JIT-ing</strong> your code from IL to machine
code that can actually be ran on a CPU. In this way, the CLR knows
exactly what your code is doing and can effectivelly <em>manage</em> it.</p>
<h2 id="umanaged-code-interoperability">Umanaged code interoperability</h2>
<p>Of course, the CLR allows passing the boundaries between managed and
unmanaged world, and there is a lot of code that does that, even in the
Base Class Libraries &lt;framework-libraries&gt;. This is called
<strong>interoperability</strong> or just <strong>interop</strong> for short. These provisions
would allow you to, for example, wrap up an unmanaged library and call
into it. However, it is important to note that once you do this, when
the code passes the boundaries of the runtime, the actual management of
the execution is again in the hand of unmanged code, and thus falls
under the same restrictions.</p>
<p>Similar to this, C# is one language that allows you to use unmanaged
constructs such as pointers directly in code by utilizing what is known
as <strong>unsafe context</strong> which designates a piece of code for which the
execution is not managed by the CLR.</p>
