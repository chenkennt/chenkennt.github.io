<p>Author: Zlatko Knezevic</p>
<p>Again, two terms that are freely used in the .NET world, they actually
are crucial to understand how the .NET platform enables multi-language
development and to understand how it works.</p>
<h2 id="common-type-system">Common Type System</h2>
<p>To start from the beggining, remember that the .NET platform is
<em>language agnostic</em>. This doesn&#39;t just mean that a programmer can write
her code in any language that can be compiled to IL. It also means that
she needs to be able to interact with code written in other languages
that are able to be used on the .NET platform.</p>
<p>In order to do this transparently, there has to be a common way to
describe all supported types. This is what the Common Type System (CTS)
is in charge of doing. It was made to do several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a framework for cross-language execution.</li>
<li>Provide an object-oriented model to support implementing various
languages on .NET platform.</li>
<li>Define a set of rules that all languages must follow when it comes
to working with types.</li>
<li>Provide a library that contains the basic primitive types that are
used in application development (i.e. <code>Boolean</code>, <code>Byte</code>,
<code>Char</code> etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>CTS defines two main kinds of types that should be supported: reference
and value types. Their names point to their definitions.</p>
<p>Reference types&#39; objects are represented by a reference to the object&#39;s
actual value; a reference here is similar to a pointer in C/C++. It
simply refers to a memory location where the objects&#39; values are. This
has a profound impact on how these types are used. If you assign a
reference type to a variable and then pass that variable into a method,
for instance, any changes to the object will be reflected on the main
object; there is no copying.</p>
<p>Value types are the opposite, where the objects are represented by their
vaulues. If you assign a value type to a variable, you are essentially
copying a value of the object.</p>
<p>CTS defines several categories of types, each with their specific
semantics and usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Structures</li>
<li>Enums</li>
<li>Interfaces</li>
<li>Delegates</li>
</ul>
<p>CTS also defines all other properties of the types, such as access
modifiers, what are valid type members, how inheritance and overloading
works and so on. Unfortunately, going deep into any of those is beyond
the scope of an introductory article such as this, but you can consult
More resources section at the end for links to more in-depth content
that covers these topics.</p>
<h2 id="common-language-specification">Common Language Specification</h2>
<p>To enable full interoperability scenarios, all objects that are created
in code must rely on some commonality in the languages that are
consuming them (are their <em>callers</em>). Since there are numerous different
languages, .NET platform has specified those commonalities in something
called the <strong>Common Language Specification</strong> (CLS). CLS defines a set of
features that are needed by many common applications. It also provides a
sort of recipe for any language that is implemented on top of .NET
platform on what it needs to support.</p>
<p>CLS is a subset of the CTS. This means that all of the rules in the CTS
also apply to the CLS, unless the CLS rules are more strict. If a
component is built using only the rules in the CLS, that is, it exposes
only the CLS features in its API, it is said to be <strong>CLS-compliant</strong>.
For instance, the &lt;framework-librares&gt; are CLS-compliant precisely
because they need to work across all of the languages that are supported
on the .NET platform.</p>
<p>You can consult the documents in the More Resources section below to
get an overview of all the features in the CLS.</p>
